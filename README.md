## Overview
This repository contains data analysis, scraping scripts, and machine learning models aimed at predicting the outcomes of the BNK48 & CGM48 16th Single General Election. The data is sourced from the [@Stats48TH](https://twitter.com/Stats48TH) Twitter account, as well as from Wikipedia pages for the [3rd General Election for 12th Single](https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/การเลือกตั้งทั่วไปเซ็มบัตสึบีเอ็นเคโฟร์ตีเอต_ประจำซิงเกิลที่_12) and the [4th General Election for 16th Single](https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/การเลือกตั้งทั่วไปเซ็มบัตสึบีเอ็นเคโฟร์ตีเอต_ประจำซิงเกิลที่_16), which provide unofficial statistics for BNK48 & CGM48 members.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build predictive models using techniques such as Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM to forecast election results and determine feature importance. This analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of factors influencing the election outcomes.

## Data Source
The datasets used in this project are collected from unofficial sources and are meant for educational and exploratory purposes.

## Models
- **Regression**: To estimate the relationship between the predictors and the election results.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework used to model the intricacies within the data.
- **LightGBM**: A fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms.

## Feature Importance
An analysis of feature importance to understand which factors are most influential in predicting the election outcomes.

## Usage
Instructions for setting up, processing data, and running the models will be added here.

## License
